## Details

The Plugin tags & analyzes the visitors of the respective shop on the different levels homepage, category, product, cart & order page. If a visitor doesn't make a purchase and leaves the store we gonna shop the user interest based advertising on external website (like weather sites, news portals, communities, blogs, and much more).

Since the respective person is shown individual & dynamic advertising material with the products he or she has previously viewed, these advertising materials have a very high interaction rate and at the same time ensure a significantly increasing order completion rate.

The plugin only needs to be installed, after that it runs automatically. No advertising material needs to be created: The plugin automatically pulls the products from the online store and creates dynamic advertising materials from them. If desired, own advertising material, such as native ads, mobile advertising material formats or even videos can be played.

## Getting started

--

The releva.nz plugin is ready to use in a few steps. After installing the plugin, a product export must be created. This is needed by releva.nz to assign the user behavior in the frontend to the respective products.

The export is created here: ***Data > Elastic Export > + New Export***. As a format, you need to choose ***releva.nz***, and the recommened way of provision ***URL***.

After the export has been created and the information has been transferred to releva.nz, the tracking pixel must now be integrated in the frontend.
Therefore you need to link the DataProvider ***Trackingpixel (Relevanz)*** under ***Plugins > Content*** within a container in the head of the shop.

When using ***IO*** and ***Ceres***, we recommend to use the Container ***Template: Style***.

## Statistics
Within the backend you could find the statistics via ***Data > releva.nz***.
